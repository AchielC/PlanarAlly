    - Only the DM can access this

### Fixed
- Various initiative issues with locations

## [0.2] - 2018-04-11
This update is firstmost an update in regards to the development process so little to no new feautures are added in this release.

### Added
- A save file version is added to the save to possibly convert older saves in the future.

    - Whenever you mouse-over a shape you own the text will appear at top of the screen
    - This is mostly a DM tool but players can use it as well.

### Fixed
- Websocket protocol now correctly chosen at the client side, this caused players to just see a blank scene in some situations
- Players on a different IP as the dm now actually see images.
- Pan and zoom options are now remembered per user AND location instead of only per user.
- MovementObstruction and visionObstruction were not immediately synced on toggle.
- Groupselect now behaves more predictable when one member collides with a movement blocker

### Changed
